p=0 #give p a definition
for n in range (1,13): #I use n=12 as a example, we can calculate the total number of pizza slices by changing the number in brackets 
    p=(n**2+n+2)/2 #use the equation which given us
    print('the total number of pizza slices at',n,'cuts is',p) #print the results
#From the results we can find that 11cuts is required to make a slice for each member of the IBI1 class
